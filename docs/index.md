## Introduction
This section of the documentation will give you a short little guide on what addons are and how to use them!

This is designed to be an improved version of the SCP:RP Addon Documentation.

Please note that this is a passion project, maintained by [The Aquifer](https://discord.gg/xAU96USgBv) and any support would be appreciated.
You can find the pages on the left and the table of contents on the right.

To find the documentation with SCP:RP functions, please enter the "SCP:RP Functions" page on the left.

## How to use an addon
#### Step 1:
In your custom server, open the server settings menu from the top left. It should appear as a cog icon as shown in the image below.

And done! Your addon should work as intended. If you have any issues, such as an error appearing in the bottom right of your screen, we recommend getting help from either the script creator or someone from [The Aquifer](https://discord.gg/xAU96USgBv)!

## I'm new to this, where do I start?
Overall, the SCP: Roleplay scripting environment isn't very good learning if you've never programmed before.

What we recommend is that you go to [Roblox Creator Hub](https://create.roblox.com) and download "Roblox Studio", and use YouTube tutorials to get a greater understanding of how the engine, and LuaU work, so you can then use your abilities in addons.
